Dice: Make a class Die with one attribute called sides, which has a default value of 6. Write a method called roll_die() that prints a random number between 1 and the number of sides the die has. Make a 6-sided die and roll it 10 times.

Make a 10-sided die and a 20-sided die. Roll each die 10 times.
