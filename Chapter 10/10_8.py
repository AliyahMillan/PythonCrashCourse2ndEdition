Cats and Dogs: Make two files, cats.txt and dogs.txt. 
Store at least three names of cats in the first file and three names of dogs in the second file. 
Write a program that tries to read these files and print the contents of the file to the screen. 
Wrap your code in a try-except block to catch the FileNotFound error, and print a friendly message if a file is missing. 
Temporarily rename each of your files, and make sure the code in the except block executes properly.  
Make sure an exception is caught for either file missing.

This is cats_and_dogs.py
